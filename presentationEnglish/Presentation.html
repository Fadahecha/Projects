      <h1>Acronyms</h1>
      <p>
        An acronym is a word or name formed from the initial components of a
        longer name or phrase. Acronyms are usually formed from the initial
        letters of words, but sometimes use syllables. They can also be a
        mixture, as in <b>radar</b> (RAdio Detection And Ranging),
        <b>REGEX</b> (Regular Expression). Acronyms can be pronounced as words,
        like<b> NASA</b> and <b>UNESCO</b>; as individual letters, like in
        <b>GIF</b> (GRAPHICS INTERCHANGE FORMAT), <b>PNG</b> (PORTABLE NETWORK
        GRAPHICS); and as both letters and words, like in
        <b>JPEG</b> (pronounced JAY-peg) . Also numbers count <i>Numeronym</i>:
        <b>W3C</b> (World Wide Web Consortium).

      <p>
        Although they serve the same purpose, an acronym is not the same as an
        <i>abbreviation</i>. The main point of reference is that acronyms form
        new words while abbreviations are merely a series of letters.
